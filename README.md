# This is just a simple menu program that allows the user to choose from 3 different imaginary function options, or just exit the program
## Things I've learned:
- Setting a funtion equal to a variable (and how useful that is)
- Using functions with loops
- The absoute basics of While loops
- using 'break' inside loops to end them
- Making a loop repeat over and over again until it recieves a valid input
- Condensing long Print( ) statements into Print('Stuff','And','Things',sep ='\n') 
- The importance of Global vs Local variables (and how annoying it is)
